# API Server

(Work in progress)

Note: OpenAI API subscription is required for this API server to work as a chat server.

=> [Code](./Python)

## OpenAI API Key

I use .zshrc file on my MacOS to set my OpenAI API key value to OPENAI_API_KEY.

.zshrc
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your OpenAI API key>"
```

## Starting the API server

MacOS
```
$ python3 app.py
```

## RAG

This API server runs with RAG to answer questions from the showroom visitors on the exhibition content.

The RAG retrieves info from two sources (General info and Scenarios) for each query.

### General info on the locations in the scenes

For now, I will try the following documents generated by ChatGPT as inputs to RAG.
- [Yokohama](Python/doc/yokohama.txt)
- [Takanawa-gateway station in Tokyo](Python/doc/takanawa_gateway_station.txt)

### Scenario for each image

I have also added scenarios for those panorama images => [Scenarios](Python/scenarios/Scenarios.ipynb)
