# API Server

(Work in Progress)

Note: OpenAI API subscription is required for this API server to work as a chat server.

=> [Code](./python)

## OpenAI API Key

I use .zshrc file on my MacOS to set my OpenAI API key value to OPENAI_API_KEY.

.zshrc
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your OpenAI API key>"
```

## Starting the API server

MacOS
```
$ python3 app.py
```

## RAG

This API server runs with RAG to answer questions from the showroom visitors on the exhibition content.
