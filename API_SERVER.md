# API Server

(Work in progress)

Note: OpenAI API subscription is required for this API server to work as a chat server.

=> [Code](./Python)

## OpenAI API Key

I use .zshrc file on my MacOS to set my OpenAI API key value to OPENAI_API_KEY.

.zshrc
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your OpenAI API key>"
```

## Starting the API server

MacOS
```
$ python3 app.py
```

## RAG

This API server runs with RAG to answer questions from the showroom visitors on the exhibition content.

For now, I will try the following documents generated by ChatGPT as inputs to RAG.
- [Yokohama](Python/doc/yokohama.txt)
- [Takanawa-gateway station in Tokyo](Python/doc/takanawa_gateway_station.txt)
