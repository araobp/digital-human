## Importing 240-degree photos into Unity as Texture 2D

I use my iPhone SE to caputre 240-degree panorama photos, then save them in the folder below.

Let's set them to 16k resolution for better photo quality.

## Testing Chatbot animation on Unity 

I think 240-degree panorama screen is ideal for VR experiences with naked eyes at a showroom or an exhibition.

## Tips

### Autscroll to bottom

The scrollbar in the Scrollview component should automatically scroll to the bottom.

Setting the pivot Y value to zero solves it.

### Animation loop

Check "Loop Time" for "Blink" and "Speak" animations to replay them in a loop.
