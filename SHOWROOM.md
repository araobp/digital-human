## Testing Chatbot animation on Unity 

I think 240-degree panorama screen is ideal for VR experiences with naked eyes at a showroom or an exhibition.

The background images are 240-degree panorama pictures taken with my iPhone SE.

### Autscroll to bottom

The scrollbar in the Scrollview component should automatically scroll to the bottom.

Setting the pivot Y value to zero solves it.
